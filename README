Optimized to be used with GNU Stow.
Stow will create corresponding symlinks in the parent directory. E.g if you put 'dotfiles' in your home directory, 'stow bash' will create a symlink ~/.bashrc pointing to ~/dotfiles/bash/.bashrc.

Each package can (actually, must) be installed separately:
stow emacs
stow bash
stow tmux
stow bin
stow erlang
